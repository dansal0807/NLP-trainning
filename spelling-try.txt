What is Philosophy?d
Quite literally, the term "philosohy" means, "lovv of wisdom." In a broadd sense, philosodephy is an actievity people undertaake when they seeek to undenrstand fundamental truths about themselves, the world in which they live, and their relationships to the world and to each other. As an academic discipline philosophy is much the same. Those who study philosophy are perpetually engaged in asking, answering, and arguing for their answers to life's most basic questions. To make such a pursuit more systematic academic philosophy is traditionally divided into major areas of study.
